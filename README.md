# What is Olansi air purifier / air purifier?

Olansi air purifier, also known as air filter and air purifier, is a product that can filter or kill air pollutants and effectively improve the cleanliness of the air. Some air conditioners, heaters and other air 
conditioners also have a limited air purification function.

# Olansi air purifier protects you from viruses and bacteria

When used properly, orange air filters can help reduce airborne pollutants, including viruses, in buildings or small spaces. Air cleaner or filtration alone is not enough to protect people from the invasion of Cowid-19.

Olansi air purifiers are designed to filter pollutants or contaminants in the air through them. Air purification and filtration help reduce pollutants in the air, including particles that contain viruses. Portable air purifiers (also known as air purifiers) can be particularly helpful in situations where indoor comfort (temperature or humidity) is unaffected or when outdoor air pollution is severe.

# Working principle and types of Olansi air purifiers

Olansi air purifier usually consists of fan and air filter system. Its working principle is: the fan inside the machine (also called the fan) circulates the indoor air, and the polluted air will be removed or absorbed various harmful substances through the filter inside the machine to achieve or achieve the purpose of cleaning and purifying the air .

Air purifiers are generally wall mounted, suspended, ceiling mounted and floor mounted; According to the air purification technology, it is divided into: HEPA air purifier, activated carbon air purifier, electronic air purifier, ultraviolet air purifier, clean room air purifier, negative ion air purifier, ion air purifier, ozone air purifier, etc.

# Main technology of Olansi air purifiers

There are many different technologies and media in the air purifier that can provide users with clean and safe air. Common air purification technologies include HEPA high-efficiency filtration technology, photoplasma technology, adsorption technology, negative ion technology, negative oxygen ion technology, molecular complexation technology, titanium dioxide photocatalyst technology, electrostatic dust collection technology, active oxygen technology, etc. The material technology mainly includes: photocatalyst, Activated carbon, synthetic fiber, HEPA efficient material, negative ion generator, etc. Most of the existing air purifiers are of composite type, that is, a variety of purification technologies and materials are used at the same time.

# HEPA filter screen

High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) is the most popular technology used in air purifiers and it is also the most stable and zero-effect physical filtration method. The HEPA filter screen can absorb 99.7% of 0.3μm suspended particles (0.3μm is the most difficult size to filter), making the inhaled air fresher and cleaner. In general, HEPA filters can absorb chemical smog, bacteria, dust particles and pollen. The advantage of the HEPA filter is effective and safe. The filtration capacity is higher than that of electrostatic dust collection technology, but it cannot remove harmful gases. With the improvement of the Hepa level (mostly H11~H13 on the market), the greater the winch resistance, the more the noise. Please choose the appropriate filter screen according to the specific environment (please try to use H12 and the top filter screen in the heavily polluted environment). In addition, the filter screen that cannot be replaced in time is also easy to become a breeding ground for bacteria breeding, resulting in secondary pollution. Users should check or use the air purifier regularly with intelligent filter management technology; The air purifier using Hepa should have a good airtight design, otherwise the air will go around the filter screen and lose the filtering effect. photoplasma. O2 and H2O molecules in the air are irradiated by special wavelength nanotube and decomposed into plasma streams with high-oxidation photoplasma. These photoplasma currents with a large number of electronic bonds have the ability to destroy organic molecules. They can quickly neutralize volatile formaldehyde, toluene, VOC and other gas molecules in the air and decompose them into water and carbon dioxide, while the technology itself does not produce other harmful substances. The water molecules formed by neutralizing formaldehyde molecules can continue to re-act through the nanotube, and the pollutants can be completely decomposed by such a chain reaction. Photocatalyst. Under ultraviolet light, the photocatalyst can decompose and disinfect many harmful gases.

# Activated carbon filter

The activated carbon filter screen has a significant impact on the deodorization and absorption of harmful gases; However, in order to filter the suspended particles, it is necessary to use Hepa and other types of filters. The advantage is safe and effective, the disadvantage is high replacement costs.
Antiviral/Antibacterial Respiratory Filters. The most effective, safe and affordable solution to prevent viral and bacterial cross-contamination
Antiviral and Antibacterial respirator filters offer a simple way to ensure cross-contamination is prevented, ensuring patient and operator safety without compromising the affecting system performance.
The use of filters in lung function and metabolism tests can also reduce the diffusion of airborne aerosol droplets and reduce environmental pollution caused by forced exchange and hyperventilation during the test. Preventing aerosol diffusion is key to reducing the spread of infectious diseases.
UVC Air Purifier / UV-C Air Purifier

This is not a coincidence because HEPA air filter is the basis of air purification quality. Ultraviolet light is one of the three types of ultraviolet light commonly used in air purification. When used properly, this invisible light can, in some cases, safely kill bacteria, mold, and even bacteria and viruses.
Olansi has an industry leading air purifier that can be used to reduce mold spores, pollen, dust and odour. If you need help to choose the right air purifier, please contact us immediately. We are happy to help you choose the right products according to your specific needs.

From the bedroom to the business office, we all have the right air purifier to create a healthy space for everyone!

# Effectiveness of Olansi air purifiers

Olansi Air Purifier cannot solve the problem of carbon dioxide concentration increase unless the air is introduced from the outside. Some models are fixed on the window to filter the outside air directly into the room. The air purifier has a bad effect on the second-hand smoke, and the ventilation capacity to slow down the second-hand damage is extremely high, and the consumption speed of the filter screen is extremely fast, so it is better to use a strong exhaust Fan to extract the second-hand smoke from the room (this is why the sensible anti-smoking law requires a total ban on smoking indoors and within a certain distance from doors and windows); Just like the kitchen is the use of range hood to reduce smoke damage.
